#Â Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) Setup

This guide takes you through setting up Amazon SES.


## Why?

All Software as a Service (SaaS) Products that create value send **`email`**. <br />
Even if it's just a reminder to pay a bill,
an **`email`** has to be sent _reliably_. <br />
Amazon's SES is a _reliable_ and _~~cheap~~_ _cheapest_ email service.

[@dwyl](https://github.com/dwyl) we _rely_ on **`email`** as our _primary_
[feedback loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback).
Without **`email`** we cannot _communicate_
with the people who are using our App.


## What?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Email Service (SES)
lets you **send** and **_receive_ email**. <br />
Additionally, for more advanced users SES
has
[***notifications***](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/notification-contents.html)
with _insights_
about the email messages you send
e.g: **`delivery`**, **`bounce`** or **`complaint`**.

> We are not going to explore notifications in _this_ setup guide,
but we have a Lambda Function: https://github.com/dwyl/aws-ses-lambda
that you should consider exploring if you want a _turn-key_
solution to your AWS SES needs.


## Who?

Anyone building an App
who wants to have control over their **`email`**.


## How?

Prerequisites:
This guide assumes you already have an AWS account.
Additionally, if you plan to follow along with
the _practical_ side of sending emails,
some familiarity with `JavaScript`
is advantageous but _not required_.

### Setup

Login to your AWS account
and visit the SES endpoint:
