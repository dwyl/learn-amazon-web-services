#Â Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) Setup

## Why?




## What?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Email Service (SES)
lets you **send** and **_receive_ email**. <br />
Additionally, for more advanced users SES
has
[***notifications***](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/notification-contents.html)
with _insights_
about the email messages you send
e.g: **`delivery`**, **`bounce`** or **`complaint`**.

> We are not going to explore notifications in _this_ setup guide,
but we have a Lambda Function: https://github.com/dwyl/aws-ses-lambda
that you should consider exploring if you want a _turn-key_
solution to your AWS SES needs.
